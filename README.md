## Technologies Used

This project leverages modern web development tools and pre-processors, indicating a robust front-end build:

* **SCSS (Sass):** Used for pre-processing CSS, enabling more organized, maintainable, and powerful styling for the game's visuals and interface.
* **Haml:** A templating engine that generates clean HTML, providing a concise and elegant way to structure the game's pages.
* **JavaScript (Implied):** Although not the highest percentage by source, JavaScript is essential for game logic, interactive elements, character control, and overall game flow in any web game. Its presence is expected within the `src` and `dist` folders.

## Files & Structure

The repository is structured for development and distribution:

* `src/`: Contains the source files (Haml, SCSS, and likely JavaScript) where development happens.
* `dist/`: This directory holds the compiled or production-ready versions of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, ready for deployment.
* `LICENSE`: Details the project's [MIT License](https://github.com/dannz510/The-Mine-Game/blob/main/LICENSE).
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To play "The-Mine-Game" locally, follow these steps. You may need to run a build process if `dist/` is not up-to-date or if you intend to modify the `src/` files.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dannz510/The-Mine-Game.git](https://github.com/dannz510/The-Mine-Game.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd The-Mine-Game
    ```
3.  **Open the game:**
    Open the `index.html` file located within the `dist/` directory in your preferred web browser.
    *(Example command assuming `index.html` is in `dist/`):*
    ```bash
    open dist/index.html
    # Or manually navigate to file:///[path-to-your-repo]/The-Mine-Game/dist/index.html in your browser.
    ```
    *(Note: If you're developing and making changes in `src/`, you'll need to set up a Haml/SCSS compiler and possibly a JavaScript bundler to generate updated files in `dist/`.)*
